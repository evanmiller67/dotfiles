## Dot files
A few dot files to make switching machines easier.

Quite a few assumptions, like assuming OS X, rvm, play, gcc-4.2, etc.

### License
I don't care. This is all stuff you can find on your own anyway -- I just made it easy for you (if you use it). If you like it enough, buy me a beer.


## Other things to install
- homebrew
- bash-it
  - aliases, completion, plugins
